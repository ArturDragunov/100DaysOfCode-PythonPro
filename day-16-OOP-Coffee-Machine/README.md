By Dr. Angela Yu

*Day 16 of 100:* Coffee Machine with Object-Oriented Programming

## Project Overview

This project is a refactored version of the Coffee Machine application from Day 15 of the 100 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp. The original procedural code has been restructured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance modularity and maintainability.

### Key Features

- **Classes**: The application is organized into classes: `CoffeeMaker`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, and `MoneyMachine`.
- **Responsibilities**: Each class has a distinct responsibility, such as managing resources, handling payments, and maintaining the menu.
- **Functionality**: The application allows users to select a drink, checks for sufficient resources, processes payments, and updates resources accordingly.
