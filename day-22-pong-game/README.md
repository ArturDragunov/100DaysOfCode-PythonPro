## Project Overview

A classic Pong arcade game implementation using Python's Turtle graphics. Two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen and compete to hit a ball past their opponent's paddle.

## Key Features

- Physics-based ball movement with increasing speed
- Collision detection with walls and paddles
- Score tracking system for both players
- Ball resets after scoring
- Paddle movement constraints

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py` to start the game
2. Player 1: Use 'W' and 'S' keys to move the left paddle up and down
3. Player 2: Use 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move the right paddle
4. Score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle
5. The ball speeds up after each paddle hit for increased challenge
