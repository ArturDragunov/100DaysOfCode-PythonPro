## About

This repository is part of my personal challenge to complete the 100-day Python Pro Bootcamp. The goal is to learn something new every day and build a portfolio of 100 Python projects.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into 100 days, with each day focusing on a specific topic or project. Here's a brief overview:

- **Days 1-10:** Python Basics and Beginner Projects
- **Days 11-20:** Intermediate Projects and Concepts
- **Days 21-30:** Advanced Topics and Projects
- **Days 31-100:** Professional Portfolio Projects

## Projects

Each project will have its own directory with the following structure:
project-name/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ code/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

## Progress

I will update this section daily with my progress and any insights or challenges I encounter.

## Learnings

This section will contain key takeaways and concepts I learn throughout the course.
